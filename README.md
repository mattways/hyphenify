# Dashify

Makes tags helpers use dashes in rails.

## Why

I did this gem to:

- Normalize all html with dashes instead of underscores.

## Install

Put this line in your Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'dashify'
```

Then bundle:
```
$ bundle
```

## Usage

Nothing to do! Yay!

## Contributing

Any issue, pull request, comment of any kind is more than welcome!

I will mainly ensure compatibility to PostgreSQL, AWS, Redis, Elasticsearch, FreeBSD and Memcached.Â
